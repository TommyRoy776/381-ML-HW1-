    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of a variable is to store data in the program. A variable stores the most smallest amount of data that we can work with in a programming language. Three main types of variables Python uses are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Numbers (Integers or floats)\n",
    "2. Boolean (True/False)\n",
    "3. Strings (Words and lists of characters)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we will be working with data, we will primarily be interested in working with numbers. Python automatically handles setting the type of variable when it is created. Every type of variable should allow for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assignment (create a variable and assign it a value)\n",
    "2. Modification (reassign the value)\n",
    "3. Reference (access the value)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a number, the above operations can be accomplished with standard arithmetic operations (=,+,-,/,*). The names of variables must start with letters (not numbers)."

    "\n",
    "Variable assignment creates a new variable, assigning a section of computer memory to save it, setting a value to the memory, and setting a name that references the memory that can be used in the program. When a variable is assigned, the variable name is on the left side of `=` and the value is on the right side.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modification\n",
    "\n",
    "Modifying a variable is similar to assigning a value to a variable that already exist. Using the name of a preexisting variable, a new value for the variable is saved. It is best practice for the new value of the variable to be the same type of data as the original (i.e. if a variable is initialized as `x=5`, then when `x` is modified its value should be set to another number). Similar to assignment, when modifying the value of a variable, the variable name is on the left of `=` and the new value is on the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference\n",
    "\n",
    "Referencing a variable accesses the value of the variable and passes the saved data to a new piece of the program. When referencing the variable, the variable will appear either on the right side of `=`, within a function call or in the condition of a control section in the code."
